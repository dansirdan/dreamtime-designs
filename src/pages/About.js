              Drawing, painting, or some form of art creation has always been a part of Melony Mont-
Etonâ€™s life. She grew up living around the world in countries like South America, Thailand,
Indonesia, Greece and the Middle East. Her exposure to this rich tapestry of cultural
influences during her formative years laid the foundation for her unique artistic voice.
                <br />
                <br />
                As a seasoned traveler, Melony draws inspiration from her global experiences and the
scenic landscape of her current home in Colorado. Her artistic philosophy is one of
unrestricted exploration, refusing to confine herself to a singular medium, style, or
concept. For her, life is an ongoing voyage of discovery, and art serves as a medium
through which she can express and navigate this exploration.

                When struck by inspiration, Melony follows a unique process. She transforms her
experiences into a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes within her imagination, creating a
dream-like state. This internal vision serves as the blueprint for her paintings, allowing her
to translate the intangible into tangible masterpieces.
